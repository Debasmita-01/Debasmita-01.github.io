## Installation & Deployment 📦
- Clone the repository and modify the content of <b>index.html</b> according to your requirement.
- Add or remove images from `Debasmita-01.github.io/assets/img/` directory as per your requirement.
- I highly recommend to use Github Pages to deploy the website the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, first you need to create github repository with name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give any other name.
